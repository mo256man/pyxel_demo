# pyxel_demo — Web Pyxel single-file demo

This branch will contain a single-file Pyxel app that can be executed via the Pyxel Web Launcher.

Run (example):
https://kitao.github.io/pyxel/wasm/launcher/?run=mo256man.pyxel_demo.web_game

Notes:
- The entrypoint is `web_game.py` at the repository root.
- Screen size: 256×256.
- Controls: none (view-only automatic simulation).
- This is a single-file placeholder game. The final game specification will be provided later; further development will continue on the branch `web-pyxel-game`.

How to test locally (optional):
If you want to run locally with a Python environment and installed Pyxel:
1. Install pyxel in your Python environment.
2. Run: `python web_game.py`

(For browser execution, use the Pyxel Web Launcher URL above.)
